# Netvor Frontend Interview Assignment

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Run `yarn dev` to start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## The Task

The task is explained in Figma:

Feel free to duplicate the Figma file to your drafts to be able to inspect the design more closely.

The Button component is not fully implemented, so you will need to finish it.

You can try to replicate the Demo frame from Figma. The design is not pixel-perfect, so don't worry if it's not 100% the same.

You can edit any file in the project. And if you see any code that you think could be improved, feel free to refactor it.

## Submission

Please submit your solution as a pull request to this repository.
